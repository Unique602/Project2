     *used to generate m (e.g., m = 10) orders. Each order is an OrderObject class object. 
     *The object is sent to the encoder/decoder threads for encoding. The encoded string 
     *is sent back to the retailer. Different ways are possible; for example, one can define 
     *a one-cell buffer with a getID method. A retailer reads the string if the ID matches. 
     *Then, the string is sent to the chicken farm thread through a multicell buffer. 
     *A semaphore can be used to manage the cells. Each retailer thread will print a list of 
     *human-friendly output (orders placed).

    /*
     * A deadlock can occur in such a complex multithreading program 
     * if the threads and shared resources are not properly planned and 
     * designed; for example, if one creates three objects to transfer the 
     * three pieces of data: senderID, cardNo, and amount, respectively, and 
     * different retailers can hold (lock) an object while waiting for the second 
     * object, or holding two objects and waiting for the third object, a deadlock 
     * can occur. Figure 2.30 shows a design where deadlock can occur.
     * 
     * That a deadlock can occur does not mean a deadlock will occur every time. 
     * It also depends on timing. This situation actually makes things worse, as 
     * you may not detect the deadlock possibility during the test phase.
